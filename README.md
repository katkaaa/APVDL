# Youtube downloading tool
This tool allows you to download videos (or audio) from mainly youtube, although it should work on all of the [supported websites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).
This is basically an embed of [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). I got rid of the cluttering in the command line and set the config to be somewhat optimal, but feel free to mess with it, if you know what you're doing.

# Installation
You will need:
 - [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (make sure it's in **PATH**)

In CMD (as administrator), run the following command:

``cd <the path you downloaded this repo to>``

and then:

``python3 pip install requirements.txt``

This will ensure you have all the dependencies required for this program to work.


# How to use?
Just follow the steps in the terminal! Everything should be straight forward.


# Issues
As of writing this README.md, it seems that everything is working correctly. Please submit an issue if you find one.


# Getting help
In case something doesn't work:
 - Make sure you have everything set up correctly
 - Try updating the yt-dlp package using:
    ``python3 pip install yt-dlp``
 - If neither of these work, **submit an issue**.


## Note
This program was created solely for **educational purposes**.
